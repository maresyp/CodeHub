DB: Ah... I wanted to know where the first kit aid was stored.

K: What did you go to get hurt again this time?
H: Oh... No, I guess I got hurt in the fight, the other night.

DB: How could someone bite you that hard...
It could've been disastrous...

H: Eh...?! Why?
DB: Eonni, could you take care of the rest for me?

BJ: Is that so?
BH: By the way, big sis is getting on my nerve recently, she is doing whatever she wants.
I feel like my opinion doesn't matter anymore.
BH: Being ignored and treated like a kid by her is pissing me off so much.
BJ: Here we go again... Do you really think she's acting like this with you because you're our step-sister?
BH: ......
BH: Eonni, you will never understand this feeling.
BJ: Yeah ~ Yeah ~ It's always the same story with you.

Slurp...

BJ: It's so difficult to do it myself...
BH: Ugh, what're you doing?!
BJ: You know...
It hurts when I scratch it with my fingernails.
BJ: Argh! Fuck it.
