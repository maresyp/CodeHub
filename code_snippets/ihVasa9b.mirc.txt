write mIRC code for a rock scissors paper game. Write an alias "choose" that returns rock, scissors or paper using $rand(1,3) to play the respective choice against the player. When a game is triggered set a variable "play" with the value of the"choose" alias and then figure out who won by comparing the players choice to the value that choose returned.
 
Here's the mIRC code for a rock-paper-scissors game using an "alias" named "choose" to randomly select the computer's choice:
 
perl
 
; Rock-paper-scissors game
 
alias choose {
  var %choice = $rand(1,3)
  if (%choice == 1) {
    return rock
  }
  elseif (%choice == 2) {
    return paper
  }
  else {
    return scissors
  }
}
 
on *:TEXT:!rps*:#: {
  set %play $choose
  msg # You chose $2-
  msg # The computer chose %play
  if ($2 == rock && %play == scissors || $2 == paper && %play == rock || $2 == scissors && %play == paper) {
    msg # You win!
  }
  elseif ($2 == %play) {
    msg # It's a tie!
  }
  else {
    msg # The computer wins!
  }
}
 
To use the game, simply type "!rps rock" (or "paper" or "scissors") in a channel where the bot is present, and it will play a round of rock-paper-scissors against you. The "on TEXT" event triggers whenever someone types "!rps" followed by a choice, and sets the "%play" variable to the computer's random choice using the "choose" alias. The script then compares your choice to the computer's choice to determine the winner and sends a message to the channel indicating the outcome of the game.
