It's on me!

TITLE DROPS







Splaaaash...
Swishhhh...
Grip
Swoosh-
Swoosh-

VP: Has the schedule been set yet?
S: The vote is expected to be held at the end of the year.
S: I'll tell you the details on the way.

S: Out of the 12 voters, 4 of them are expected to give their vote to the Vice-President unless there is a major change.
S: Another 4 are not expected to give their vote to the Vice-President because of their deep-seated aversion for the chairman.

Thud-

VP: In times like this, being blood-related with this old geezer isn't at my advantage...
VP: Anyway, everything will depend on our ability to get the last 4 voters...
That's all we need to think about...
VP: {I'm wondering how it's going for your other whore of daughter...}
VP: ...
VP: Hmm?
SY: Mister, it always amazes me how much you like sweet things~
MC: Life is bitter... So I want to eat something sweet.

Even if the taste is similar to what I get from a vending machine coffee...

VP: Lee Ho-Seung?
VP: The woman next to him...
She's the candidate I chose for my father.
SY: What's this? It's so cheezy~
It sounds like a soap opera line~
VP: ...
VP: The relationship between these two doesn't look formal at all, interesting...
S: Shall I investigate that female employee?
VP: ...
VP: No, you don't have to.
VP: Pull over.
S: Yes.

Screech-

SY & MC: ...?

Hiss- [or] Wiiiing- (Dunno xd)

VP: You're going to work, right?
VP: Get in.
SY & MC: ...

Clank-

VP: What're you doing? Quickly, get in.
VP: Let's go together.
