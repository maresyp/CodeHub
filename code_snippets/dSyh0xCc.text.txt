Then, it will  send  the  text  on  pastebin  with  the  given       options.     POST AS A REGISTERED USER       To  post as a registered user, you must generate a file containing your       username and password.  To do so, run "pastebincl --usergen".   OPTIONS        The possible arguments are:         -v, --version              Prints the program  version  and  basic  informatons,  and  then              returns.         -h, -?, --help              Prints a short help, and then returns.         --licence              Prints the program licence, and then returns.         --usergen              Generates an "users" file for the software with the informations              given afterwards.         -n [name], --name=[name]              Defines [name] as the paste name.         -s [syntax], --syntax=[syntax]              Defines [syntax] as the  syntax  highlighting  pattern  of  your              text,  eg.
