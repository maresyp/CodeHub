DiscoDude: Session logging commenced
Ryusui|GM: EXCHANGE 11/12
Ryusui|GM: "Aaaaaaaah..." the Beryllium Chef says as his [Several Citrus Fruits] tumble into a large bowl with some other unspecifiable ingredients. He pours something else in on top of them and begins to stir.
Ryusui|GM: (attempting to make [Gummy Candy Guts (Sour): 8])
Ryusui|GM: !f 3 (Sour)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF+3 for 1 [4dF = [-][ ][-][ ]]
Ryusui|GM: (whoof, that is...really close. I'm going to spend both invokes on the fruit, spend a FATE Point on the fruit itself, and one more on his Unshakable Confidence)
Ryusui|GM: What comes out of the bowl is...something translucent and stretchy. He opens an aperture in one end of the mass, blows into it, and with some surprisingly deft artistic twists and ties makes something akin to a balloon animal out of gummy candy, albeit in the shape of a prehistoric creature's internal organs. These he deftly inserts into the iceasaurus skeleton's ribcage.
Ryusui|GM: Dovelia's "what is he doing?!?" expression only intensifies. She looks at the [Exoplanetary Bok Choi] on her own chopping block and sets to work delicately carving figurines out of vegetable matter.
Ryusui|GM: (attempting to make [Bok Choi Royal Court (Bitter): 6])
Ryusui|GM: !f 2 (Bitter)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF+2 for 0 [4dF = [-][ ][ ][-]]
Vera: (Remember; Dovelia has a separate track.)
Ryusui|GM: (yes)
Ryusui|GM: (and i remember this time she has a stunt for exactly this situation)
Ryusui|GM: (so I only need the one invoke off the Bok Choi, and a FATE Point invoke, and that puts her at 1)
Ryusui|GM: At long last, she finishes making a pair of tiny crowns out of the dark leaves, and sets them on the king and queen in her ice castle. She looks at her masterwork and can barely suppress a diabolical giggle.
Vera: (What are you saving the other bok-choi invoke for?)
Vera: "I dunno in what galaxy those qualify as 'dishes,' but..." Vera stops mid-sentence. The camera pans over to Holly standing next to her, finger raised as though she was about the say something. Vera raises her own finger to Holly's nonexistant lips. "Don't."
Ryusui|GM: (there only was the one, i thought?)
Vera: (There was 2.)
Ryusui|GM: (no, it was 1; i won the roll, not SWS'd it)
Ryusui|GM: (i'm looking at the log rn)
Vera: (Alright then.)
Ryusui|GM: (i fucked up the ingredient-getting rolls last time anyway so giving myself any undue advantage would probably not be fair XD)
Vera: (Describe your victory, then.)
Ryusui|GM: (i did)
Vera: (Ah.)
Vera: "I dunno in what galaxy those qualify as 'dishes,' but..." Vera stops mid-sentence. The camera pans over to Holly standing next to her, finger raised as though she was about the say something. Vera raises her own finger to Holly's nonexistant lips. "Don't."
She plugs the daggers with "hilts" of ice, then drags herself back out to Center Arena for the second time - this time, for the lardertron.
"Gonna need some damn good salt for this next bit." She starts searching up salts of all kinds. She's relying on her vast ingredient trivia knowledge to figure out which one has the strange properties she wants.
Vera: (Rolling CLEVER on the lardertron.)
Ryusui|GM: (hit it)
Vera: !f 3 (CLEVER)
DiscoDude: <@Vera> rolled 4dF+3 for 5 [4dF = [+][+][ ][ ]]
Vera: (*fist-pump)
Ryusui|GM: (SWS~)
Vera: "What was it... Zatar- Shitirne- SATURNZ! That was it!" She snaps her fingers and punches in the obscure region name. Sure enough, Saturnz-Barz Cane Salt (SAVORY) [!!] appears among the cross-reference results. There's a whole bag of it available, too! "Yes yes yes f*ck yes! Gonna need all of it I can get - you'll see why I picked this particular salt for a dessert dish soon enough!"
Ryusui|GM: Out pops the salt, in a deluxe velvet bag no less!
Ryusui|GM: ( <@!Margen>, <@!;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾>?)
Vera: (I'm sure the phrase "cane salt" will raise some eyebrows. >:3)
Ryusui|GM: (yeah XD)
Margen: Margen, armed with the Real Dragon Fruit (Harvested from Real Fruit Dragons), takes to the block. With expert precision, he slices the fruit(?) thin, blast-freezes it to blet it, skewers the papery medallions, and roasts the meat(?) nodules in the broiler. Below the fruit(?), there is a large saucepan of butter, wine, and onions, and the oven door is open to allow steam out. He sweats under the heat of the oven and smiles wryly as he stares down his ancient foe, one of the most storied meat-fruit sauces ever devised: Dragon's Blood Confite (Savory 7)
Margen: !f 3 (savory vs 7)
DiscoDude: <@Margen> rolled 4dF+3 for 7 [4dF = [+][+][+][+]]
Margen: (!!!)
Ryusui|GM: (woo, get a free - but invokeless - Popularity Aspect for this~)
Margen: The Master Sauceror churns the ovenbound cauldron with multiple elongated spoons, the deep maroon liquid simmering densely in the four-quart roasting pan, stirring and bubbling in a captivating rhythm.

;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Just needed to look at the doc; sorry.))
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: Once Mel set Tako-San back on the counter, he starts mixing in a few other spices, a little wasabi, a little black pepper, a little if whatever was in that jar with a picture a faceless serpent emerging from beneath an endless desert, and just sees what happens.
((Create an Advantage to place a Spicy:8 side dish aspect))

;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((And I will compel a confessional.))
Vera: (You'll need to describe your failure, first.)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: Mel starts getting twitchy, eyes glazing over blue, audible panic in her heavy breathing.  Tak-San, worried about his assistant and friend, stops what they’re doing to help what may be an alien-induced seizure.
Once Mel calms back down, Tako-San asks, “What happened?”
“I don’t know!” Mel replied, “I took a taste of that new spice you were using and I started hallucinating.”
“Aii-ya~~....”
“At least it wasn’t all bad; saw a T.n.T. location on a space station.”
“Eh?”
Ryusui|GM: -VWORP-
Ryusui|GM: "Don't you know better than to let Earthlings around alien substances?" Holly croons, emphasizing the words "Earthling" in a way that implies she doesn't believe Tako is one at all.

;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: “Where’s Mel?!  I need to know if she’s O.K!”  Tako-San definitely makes a show out  of playing up his very real and genuine concern for her.

Ryusui|GM: "Pfft, like we'd actually let non-chefs die in Kitchen Arena," Holly laughs. "You should be worrying more about yourself,* after a slip-up like that..."
Ryusui|GM: And she drops you back into reality.
Ryusui|GM: (IIRC success on one of these gets you a popularity aspect too, I think?)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Yeah.))
Vera: (No invoke, but yeah.)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Caring Connoisseur))
Ryusui|GM: (shall we move on to the final exchange, then?)
Margen: (sure)
Vera: (Yee.)
Ryusui|GM: FINAL EXCHANGE
Ryusui|GM: "Oh boy! Is time to paint the house red now!" The Beryllium Chef approaches his "dish" with the [Spacewater Taffy] in a bucket. With almost cavalier effort, he begins drawing strands of the glittering pink sweet and using them to reinforce the joints of his creation, decorating it with [Taffy Ligaments (Sweet): 6].
Ryusui|GM: !f 3 (Sweet)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF+3 for 3 [4dF = [+][-][-][+]]
Ryusui|GM: (and the two invokes on the Spacewater Taffy FTW)
Ryusui|GM: This time, Dovelia hardly pays attention to the Beryllium Chef as she herself decks out her ice castle with elaborate [Moondust Fondant Decorations (Sweet): 6].
Ryusui|GM: !f 3 (Sweet)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF+3 for 1 [4dF = [-][-][+][-]]
Ryusui|GM: (PHEW. Two invokes, and Dovelia's laaaaaaast FATE Point.)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: “Really; I’m fine.”  Mel finally manages to calm down all the way and reaches to continue with the hot sauce before Tako-San her hand away.
“No time!  I’ll finish the dish; yu rest.”
Mel warmly returns a “Sure thing.”
Ryusui|GM: The Beryllium Chef looks up in awe at his mighty unfleshed dinosaur, a fleeting but striking testament to his artistic skill and, possibly, culinary talent. Dovelia looks at her fully decorated ice castle and nods in approval, then looks over at the Beryllium Chef's skeleton. Then she looks at her own castle. Then at the skeleton. Then at the castle. And for the first time since embarking on this course, she finds herself wondering: "just what the hell have I done here?!?"
Vera: As soon as Vera gets back to Station 3, she dumps all her newly-acquired salt in a pot and lights the stove.
"Okay, so; this isn't technically salt - it grew out of a plant, not the ground - but it has most of the same properties. Keyword being 'most.'" She pours a dash of water and cream in with it and lets it sit... until it starts to melt. "That's right; caramelized salt. These... things are going to be Stabbed Into a Caramel Salt Log - SAVORY:5 to finish it off. I only got one shot at this, even with this amount of salt; last-minute adrenaline rush, don't fail me now..."
Vera: !f 2 (SAVORY)
DiscoDude: <@Vera> rolled 4dF+2 for 5 [4dF = [+][+][+][ ]]
Vera: (YES! YES! FINALLY.)
Ryusui|GM: (woo~)
Margen: (Nice!)
Vera: (Anyone want to use those conditions against me finally? XD)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Yeah.))
Vera: (Both of them, I assume?)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Yeah.))
Vera: (I counter with the invokes on my salt.)
Vera: (May I proceed now?)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((I got nothing else.))
Vera: "Okay, time to stir it - I want a hard caramel salt, not a sauce." After a thorough stirring, she dumps the caramelized salt out onto a chilled sheet and spreads it around. Once it's cooled, she carefully rolls up the mahogany-colored sheet like a pinwheel cake. Noticing the clock, she decides she has no time to embellish it with bark or anything fancy like that; she just plates the small log, and stabs each dagger-shaped slushy pop along its length before it finally finishes cooling.
Ryusui|GM: ( <@!Margen>? <@!;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾>? )
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: Tako-San starts gathering up the ice on the counter and shoves it into a compressor that practically forges a taco shell out of solid ice.

;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((All according to plan.))
Vera: (Don't forget to name the aspect when you describe your victory.)
Ryusui|GM: (HOT DAMN, YO)
Ryusui|GM: (i am. honestly. legitimately. impressed.)
Vera: (Did he have any other choice? XD)
Ryusui|GM: (i suppose not but still XD)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: And right as the buzzer chimes, Tako-San places the filling into there Hard-Ice Taco-Shell.
Vera: (Margen still has to go, mind.)
Margen: Meanwhile, Margen pours a pattern of curving lines reminiscent of scales on each cone with the wine-red (and slightly glowing) concentrated flavor (Dragon's Blood Confite (Savory 7)) of his Shaved Comet Ice (Cool 8). With utmost precision, he lovingly dumps layer upon layer of bright-red candylike syrup all over the pre-striped cones, creating a sharp contrast to the criss-crossing pattern of deep dusk tones. (Sweet 7) (fingers crossed)
Margen: !f 1 (versus 7 with 2 invokes)
DiscoDude: <@Margen> rolled 4dF+1 for 1 [4dF = [+][ ][-][ ]]
Margen: (oof. going to need to reroll that with a fate point)
Vera: (Or boost with a fate point.)
Ryusui|GM: (what do you invoke? and bear in mind you can only invoke an aspect with a FATE Point once per roll)
Vera: (He has Sir Stanton and the Dragon's Tropical Topping Formula Seventeen (SWEET) [!!].)
Ryusui|GM: (i mean, you can invoke as many aspects as you like, but you can only spend a FATE Point to invoke each one once)
Vera: (He can invoke it 3 times if he spends a fate point.)
Ryusui|GM: (and yeah, for 7, you only need to +2 boost and spend your free invokes)
Ryusui|GM: (yeah)
Margen: (Oh I had 2 helpings of the sugar syrup which would get it up to 5, but I'm not sure what else I could add...
Oh RIGHT)
Margen: (yeah I'll use an FP to invoke ALLL the syrup)
Vera: (Kinda overthunk that situation there, didn't ya? XD)
Margen: Margen, unsatisfied with the sauciness of the snowcones, dumps another bottle on for good measure.
Vera: (You also need to actually name your plating aspect.)
Margen: He nods, his Dragonscale 'Drizzle' complete.
Margen: (it's more of a flood)
Margen: (everything is covered in red sugar syrup.)
Vera: (A very... *ahem... bold color.)
Ryusui|GM: And the klaxon sounds!
Ryusui|GM: "Utensils down; step away from your stations! Battle Comet is now officially over!"
Ryusui|GM: BATTLE COMET END
Vera: Vera collapses against her counter, sliding down to the floor.
"Oh lords, it's over."
Ryusui|GM: "This won't do. This won't do. What have you gotten me into, you insane little man," Dovelia mutters to herself. By all rights, the castle is beautiful, but Dovelia is clearly having doubts about letting her old Chater culinary instincts take the helm on this one.
Ryusui|GM: "I make the very best food out of ice," the Beryllium Chef says simply, as if this "fact" is no big deal. "I can't wait for the big party!"
Ryusui|GM: The arena reconfigures itself, or perhaps deft camerawork only makes it look so. Whichever it is, the chefs and their dishes are quickly assembled in front of the judges' table.
Ryusui|GM: "Chefs," the Chairwoman says, standing up from her seat. "I hope you all appreciated our competition's little surprise party favor." She smirks and looks upward briefly, as if telling you all to be prepared for another sudden comet drop. Mercifully, none comes. "You all surmounted the challenge with aplomb, and prepared dishes using the ice you seized from the dragon's hoard. Now, let us see whether you are as skillful in the kitchen as you are on the mountaintop!"
Ryusui|GM: She nods to the Beryllium Chef. "House Chef, you will set the bar!"
Ryusui|GM: "Oh boy!" the Beryllium Chef says, pushing his dinosaur skeleton on a tiny wagon. "I make the Authentic Iceasaurus Rex Skeleton, filled with gummy guts and put together with the spacewater taffy!"
Ryusui|GM: Authentic Iceasaurus Rex Skeleton (Cool): 8
filled with Gummy Candy Guts (Sour): 8
decorated with Taffy Ligaments (Sweet): 6
Ryusui|GM: !f (Judge's Reaction)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF for 0 [4dF = [ ][-][+][ ]]
Ryusui|GM: Despite the Beryllium Chef's reputation - and his unshakable permanent grin - none of the judges quite seem to know what to make of his creation. "It's quite artistic," Ziziphus says, all but stating the obvious at this point. "How, might I ask, are we supposed to eat it?"
Ryusui|GM: "Like this!" Without another word, the Beryllium Chef taps the skeleton on the ankle, and...the entire thing collapses. Dovelia visibly winces. The judges, once again, are baffled by the display...except, somehow, pieces of the skeleton - a perfectly-arranged "meal" of the ice, gummy candy, and taffy - has landed on each of their plates. Hapax sighs; he's clearly seen worse shenanigans in his day.
Vera: (And of course, Maalu is completely unfased; Been There, Ate That and what-not. XD)
Ryusui|GM: "Well, I have to say, this is quite the performance piece," Ziziphus finally says, tearing through some of the gummy candy guts. "Maybe a bit overwrought as a dessert, or even a dish in general, but you can't fault the effort put into it." "Every individual piece has been perfectly executed," the Chairwoman says. "Perhaps a bit outre for most tastes, but I do believe Kitchen Arena is the perfect home for such a dish, wouldn't you say?" Hapax doesn't reply; he's crunching the ice cubes, and trying very hard not to look like he's enjoying himself greatly doing so.
Ryusui|GM: (FINAL SCORE: 22)
Ryusui|GM: "Next up... <@!Vera>! Bring your dish forward!"
Vera: "Ah- Here!" Vera staggers up to the stage. "So, this isn't as fancy as the other dishes..." She eyes Tako's dish. "Er, most of the other dishes, but I've got for you here a set of 'gourmet slushy pops' - you know, like the tubes you suck the frozen stuff out of - shaped like daggers and stuck into a caramelized salt log. The filling is kind of an... abridged take on a muddled fruit and blood-wine granita recipe from back home. Enjoy, I guess, or don't; either way, I just want this day to end finally..."
Vera: VERA STEINBECK - SANGUINE DAGGER-POPS

DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF for 2 [4dF = [ ][ ][+][+]]
Ryusui|GM: (anything you wanna invoke?)
Vera: (... Yes. The two free invokes plus a fate point on Ziziphus's love of salt (of all kinds)... and my last fate point on Hapax's desire for more mature flavors. XD)
Ryusui|GM: (holy cow, that's eight points)
Vera: (Indeed. Imagine having a reason to hold onto fate points into judging despite a final face-off being unlikely. XD)
Ryusui|GM: "Ahahahaha...oh, my," Ziziphus says, grabbing a second pop with such glee that the Chairwoman is compelled to move the caramel salt log away from him before he eats all the remaining ones. "This gets my vote for sure." It's hard to tell if Ziziphus can get physically inebriated, but he certainly seems drunk on something in your pops. "Reminds me of the screaming bloodfruits of Galgana-7," Hapax says, biting clean through his with evident approval in his voice. "I feared I would find a second helping of ice dull after the House Chef's little performance, but I quite enjoy this." "Indeed," the Chairwoman says. "Despite your evident difficulties in this competition, you've turned around and created something truly praiseworthy here."
Ryusui|GM: (FINAL SCORE: 25)
Ryusui|GM: "Next...Dovelia!"
Ryusui|GM: Dovelia pushes her work forward with as much pride as she can muster. "I present you a dish in the Neo-Chater style," she says, bowing. "The castle is carved entirely of Comet Tail Ice; the royal court within is Exoplanetary Bok Choi; the decorations on the walls are Moondust Fondant. Do enjoy."
Ryusui|GM: Glittering Ice Castle (Cool): 8
featuring a Bok Choi Royal Court (Bitter): 6
covered in Moondust Fondant Decorations (Sweet): 6
Ryusui|GM: !f (Judges' Impressions)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui|GM> rolled 4dF for 1 [4dF = [-][+][ ][+]]
Vera: Vera doesn't know whether to be more stunned at her own success or at the fact that Dovelia put bok choi and fondant in the same dish as the primary sources of flavor.
Ryusui|GM: Ziziphus smirks and raises his metal eyebrows, and gives the others a glance like "now where have we seen this recently?" "It's quite beautiful," the Chairwoman says, struck by the artistry on display. "Though - and forgive me that this is the second time we've had to ask one of our chefs this question - how do we eat it?"
Ryusui|GM: Dovelia is about to respond when Hapax chuckles: "Like this." He is not nearly so delicate as the Beryllium Chef. With his well-trained fists, he smashes the castle to glittering rubble, and sweeps the bricks onto the judges' table. Dovelia bites her lip; the sight is physically painful to her, and it's taking her a superhuman effort to say nothing about it.
Ryusui|GM: Ziziphus picks up one of the figures. "I could get used to food like this." He squints: "Did you put faces on these? And look and their little ears and tails!" Hapax says nothing; he's gathered several of Dovelia's lovingly-crafted figurines and biting their heads off, then chewing and swallowing the rest of them. It's hard to tell, given his perpetually war-weary face, but once again he seems to be reliving some fond moment from his warlord days. "Pardon my fellow judge's approach to your dish," the Chairwoman chuckles. "I'm afraid the artistry is not quite so appreciable in this state, but once again, your effort shines through."
Ryusui|GM: (FINAL SCORE: 21)
Ryusui|GM: "Thank you, Chairwoman," Dovelia says weakly, then turns away. The Chairwoman calls out: "Tako! You're up next!"
Ryusui|GM: (<@!;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾>)
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: Tako-San slips back into his tank as Mel carts him to the judges table.
"I was originally aiming for a Meal of Ice and Fire, but without the ingredient necessary," Tako-San gives a mock glare at the Chairwoman, as if to imply it wasn't his own time-wasting that cost him his vision; "I had to settle for an equally delicious Frozen Fillet Taco."

Ryusui|GM: Crunch. Hapax is the first to bite in; his reaction is almost unreadable as he noisily, messily devours your ice taco. "Okay, lemme butt in for a second here, but you know what would make this really pop?" Ziziphus says. "Sashimi. Sashimi filling. Put a little wasabi on top, make it like a...sushi taco.*" "The filling is up to your usual standards, Tako," the Chairwoman says, "though it pains me that you were unable to complete the dish as you planned. I think I would have enjoyed a fiery counterpoint to the frozen ingredients you have here. What you have is competent, but I hate to say, nothing truly inspiring."
Ryusui|GM: (FINAL SCORE: 13)
Ryusui|GM: "Finally, <@!Margen>! Present your dish!"
Margen: Margen steps forward with a tray of vivid red ice in paper cones, and begins his presentation:

Hello good judges! Today I present a dish of my homeland, spiced up for space. It begins with a base of Purest Driven Comet-Tail Snow (COOL:8), formed into a cone. This was patterned with warm Dragon's Blood Confit (SAVORY:7) to create a ribboning, and finished with a Dragonscale 'Drizzle’ (SWEET:7) of a highly-specialized dessert topping from a small a relatively unknown little planet in the western spiral arm of the galaxy.

Ryusui|GM: "Am I the only one who really likes this? Please tell me I'm not the only one who really likes this," Ziziphus says, savoring his cone but clearly eyeing another. "The daggers were better," Hapax says bluntly. "But the color and flavor do remind me of one of my most fondly remembered battlefields..." The Chairwoman interjects before he can reminisce any further: "These are quite artfully prepared - actually artistic dishes, rather than art with an edible component, to be clear," she chuckles. Dovelia averts her gaze; the Beryllium Chef continues to grin obliviously. "I'm happy to see you're finally starting to show some ambition with your cooking; I expect to see even more interesting dishes from you in the future."
Ryusui|GM: (FINAL SCORE: 22)
Margen: Margen nods once, appreciatively
Vera: (And now, the results.)
Ryusui|GM: "And with the last of the dishes presented, it's time for the final results!"
Ryusui|GM: The Chairwoman rises and steps forward. "As each chef presented only one dish in this competition, the judging process will be a little different from usual. We have judged all your dishes in direct comparison to one another, and a clear order of superiority has emerged."
Ryusui|GM: A spotlight shines on you, Tako!
Ryusui|GM: "Tako. The individual components of your dish were excellently executed, as we've come to expect from you, but alas, your frozen taco was simply missing that spark of panache associated with your culinary style. You are, regrettably, the fourth-place finisher by a wide margin."

Your castle proved something of a puzzle for us, but the effort that went into making such a remarkable work of art on such short notice did not escape us." "Also it was fun biting their little heads off," Hapax says with uncharacteristic cheer. The Chairwoman pauses, clearly not expecting the interruption, then finishes: "You take third place."

"I make the Upside-Down Bigfoot next time!" the Beryllium Chef says, still grinning. "As for Margen, once more, I must state we all found his willingness to take risks *refreshing*; his skills as a chef are finally earning him a place in the spotlight, and they've earned him a second-place tie in this competition.

Ryusui|GM: (i had to pull off *one* last little gag at Vera's expense, though XD) Vera: She doesn't have the energy to even react to the confetti. "... *What."* Vera: (Your cue to soldier on with the end sequence while Vera continues to react with disbelief. XD) Ryusui|GM: "Vera continues to hold a commanding lead in our season rankings..." Ryusui|GM: **1. Vera (10pts)
Dovelia (5pts)
Margen (5pts)
Tako (4pts)`*
Vera: "What."
Ryusui|GM: "...however, Margen has become a force to be reckoned with! This season is still anyone's game!"
Vera: "... What?"
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((4pts by episode four))
((Did he really place last in each episode?))
Margen: Margen buzzes slightly with enthusiasm
Ryusui|GM: (no, but 4th place here means 0 points)
Vera: (The first two, yeah.)
Ryusui|GM: "Hee hee...and here we have a surprising finish to today's episode!" Holly chirps, queueing up a montage of all Vera's greatest spills, playing her tumble from the comet several times, before finally ending on a shot of her being blasted in the face by the confetti. "Tune in next time for more culinary chaos!"
Ryusui|GM: (last lines, <@&627978553669058562>?)
Vera: "... How did this happen?"
;}"÷™+╎®^★█¬ˇ¾: ((Not this time; too tired.))
Margen: Margen chirps giddily
Ryusui|GM: Dovelia takes several steps away from the rest of the chefs; then, when she thinks the cameras aren't looking at her (they totally are), she drops to her knees and howls in frustration.
Ryusui|GM: Holly queues up one last close-up shot of Vera's face staring blankly into the camera, and then...
Ryusui|GM: !end
