[10.18.2012 23:58:37] <+Zatman> in the same vein, a girl in October that says "there's a guy [long distance away] and we're thinking about the dating thing" is considered available amirite?
[10.18.2012 23:58:50] <@RedMeansGo> no
[10.18.2012 23:58:57] <@RedMeansGo> don't mess with that, move on
[10.18.2012 23:59:15] <@RedMeansGo> girls who play at being available or not...don't bother
[10.18.2012 23:59:29] <+Zatman> oh
01[10.18.2012 23:59:37] <+dbeachy1> yeah, if she says that at best it means you would play #2 to her b/f 
[10.18.2012 23:59:51] <@RedMeansGo> there is no such thing as "thinking about dating" you are or you are not, it is a binary status
01[10.18.2012 23:59:56] <+dbeachy1> lol true

06[10.19.2012 00:00:19] * +dbeachy1 wonders why they say that, though
[10.19.2012 00:00:35] <@RedMeansGo> playing at unavailability makes men want them
01[10.19.2012 00:00:37] <+dbeachy1> we need to summon a female here to ask them

[10.19.2012 00:03:33] <+Katie> i guessed that

[10.19.2012 00:03:46] <+Katie> lmao
[10.19.2012 00:04:12] <+Katie> right. so if they are thinking about dating, she is obviously interested in him. thus not really available.
