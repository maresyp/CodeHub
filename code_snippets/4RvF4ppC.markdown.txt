Chapter - 52






NOTICE:
Toptoon, the original publisher of 'Fitness' decided to write off Sang-Mi's father who is also Choon-Hwa's husband from the original story. We don't really know if he abandoned them or died but he never moved in this residence with his wife and two daughters in this story 2.0...
This sudden and major change to the story was only made to allow Choon-Hwa to have fun with other men without making her look like a cheating whore. Who will be the chosen one between Dong-Joon and Hyun-Soo, I think you all already know the answer. To be honest I wasn't a fan at all of the recent direction of the story with the focus on Sang-Mi's mother or even with what happened between Hyun-Soo and Sang-Mi...
Anyway, we'll see how it goes but you can expect me to drop this work in the near future...

FM: {People don't dress like that anymore nowadays...}
FM: {I should've asked Sang-Mi's advice about what to wear...}
FM: I'm here, coach.
D: Oh, yes you are...
D: Should we start with some light stretching since it's your first day?

K: {Look at him...}

D: {Why... Why is it so hard for me to touch her...?}

Slowly... Slowly...

D: {I just can't do it...}

D: Now, keep your hands folded just like this...

Thud
Nmm...
Slowly Slowly
Gulp...

D: {Sigh... I just can't bring myself to do it...}
FM: I should've started working out earlier. I feel so refreshed.

Haha

D: If you keep doing this kind of exercises on a daily basis you will gain a toned and more flexible body.

You're already great right now but...

FM: Pardon?
D: Uh, No-nothing...?! Please, be careful on your way home.
FM: Yes, see you next time. Dong-Joon...
FM: Aya, shouldn't I call you teacher?
D: There is no obligation, you can call me whatever the way you want.

Jiggle Jiggle
Sigh...
Grab

K: Come here!

Pull

D: Ouuuch...
D: Boss, let go of me...!

Drag  Drag


D: ......
K: Coach Dong-Joon, did you forget what you're paid for?
Trying to be a decent man now? Is it the time to act like this for you? What kind of joke did you became?
K: Acting like a teenager and being so flustered just because of an auntie like her?!
D: Well.. You know, I think it's because she's Sang-Mi's mother that I couldn't...
K: Are you Sang-Mi's boyfriend or just her personal trainer? By the way, what kind of excuse is this? Since when have you cared about that stuff?
K: Anyway, I never asked you to fuck her so don't make a fuss over small matters.
Wasn't touching women with your wandering hands was your specialty? Don't you know how to gently entertain women anymore?!
D: I... I'm sorry.
K: SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INTENTION OF DOING BUSINESS, JUST CLEAN THE WAREHOUSE AND GO HOME!
D: Yes madam...

SLAM

D: Sigh... Why am I even talking like this...?

Fumble Fumble



Huff...

D: {I don't know if I should get home right away...}
D: {I'll just sit and rest for a bit before going home...}
D: {Ah... I'm so tired...}

Doze Doze


FM: Here you're... Mister Dong-Joon...

D: !
D: UH?! SANG-MI'S MOTHER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS TIME?!

Started

FM: Well, you taught and helped me a lot today but I didn't return the favor or got the chance to thank you properly~
FM: When you were helping me with my stretching earlier, I noticed you were greatly interested in my body and wanted to touch it...

Bend

FM: Don't you want touch it right now?
D: I-I... I never did or thought about this...!

Whoosh

FM: Then, do you want me to touch you?
