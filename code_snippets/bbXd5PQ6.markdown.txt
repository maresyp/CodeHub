MC: Hey, why are you still following me? I'm already home.
H: I carried your bag from school to here!
Aren't you at least gonna give me glass of water?!!
H: Oh...
All: Uh...?!
MJ: Kyaa!
HS: Soo Cheol... You're here...
MJ: Before coming in... Why didn't you ring the bell...?
MC: WHY SHOULD I RING A FUCKING BELL BEFORE COMING INTO MY OWN HOUSE!

SLAM!

HS: This ungrateful bastard... Talking like this to his sister...
MJ: ...
H: Perhaps... Are you Min Soo-Jeong?
MJ: Uh... That's correct but...
H: Wow! Good afternoon senior! I'm Song Han-Na, also studying at Yanam High!
HS: Oh, you're Soo-Jeong's junior, what a nice and polite girl...
HS: Well... It's understandable with how scary Soo-Jeong was during high school... Keke-
MJ: What are you saying ~ ?
MJ: Anyway, stop talking about useless stuff...
MJ: And you, do you intend to stay in the living room like that?
H: Oh... I'm sorry senior, have fun.
MJ: Still... I never thought Soo-Cheol will bring a girl at home one day...
HS: Well Soo-Cheol is still a man so it was bound to happen... Kekeke ~

H: Wow, it's really well organized and clean for a man's room.
H: It also doesn't smell like Chestnut Flowers*

T/N: The flowers of Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) emit a distinctive semen-like odor

MC: Ugh... What smell of chestnut flowers?!
H: By the way, why didn't you tell me before you were Min Soo-Jeong's little brother?
MC: Why would I tell you about this in the first place?
H: Are you saying this because you really don't know the truth? Soo-Jeong was really popular when she was still studying in our school.
H: She was so famous in the neighborhood that if you didn't know her, you were seen as a spy trying to mess with her gang.
H: If I had known she was your sister earlier, do you really think I would've let a punk like Choi Byung-Min mess with you?
MC: That's enough... What's so nice about being the brother of such a slut?
H: She, a slut...? Is it because she was making love with her boyfriend earlier?
MC: ...
H: What's wrong with being in love with someone?
H: Oh my... Don't tell me...
H: Are you a virgin?
MC: I'm not... What are you imagining!
H: {Wow, he's so cute}
{He's so different from Soo-Jeong, I can't believe they are bother and sister.}
MC: What... What's wrong?
H: If you're curious about sex, I can answer most of your questions.
MC: ...

MJ: Haaang
MJ: Aaah... What're you doing...?
HS: Shouldn't we finish what me started earlier?
MJ: Stop, there are kids in the room next to us.
HS: I'm sure they'll understand they are no child anymore...
MJ: Still... I don't want them to listen to...
HS: It's all right... You'll just have to keep it quiet. Kekeke ~
MJ: Okay...
MJ: Nmm!
MJ: Heek
MJ: Huuu-uh!
MJ: Haang
MJ: Aaaah
HS: {Wow... You're really trying to hold it...}
HS: {Let's see if you can endure this}
MJ: Kyaaaah...
MJ: Haaang...
MJ: Aaaah...
HS: Kekeke ~ What's going on Soo-Jeong, didn't you say you will not make any noise?!
MJ: AAAAH!
HS: Weren't you the one who asked me to not do it because the kids were in the room next to us?! Kekeke ~
MJ: Haang! I don't care!
MJ: AAAAAH!

H&MC: ...
Mj: Aaaah!
MJ: Yeees!
H: In the next room, looks like they resumed what we interrupted earlier...
