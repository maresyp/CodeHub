WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS (THE BEATLES)
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
I don't know how nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
 
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
 
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
ANA NO DUERME (ALMENDRA)
Ana no duerme
Espera el día
Sola en su cuarto
Ana quiere jugar
 
Sobre la alfombra
Toca su sombra
Cuenta las luces
Mira la gran ciudad
 
Ana no duerme
Juega con hadas
Tal vez mañana despierte
Sobre el mar, el mar
Sobre el mar, el mar
 
Ana de noche
Hoy es un hada
Canta palabras
Canta y se torna en luz
 
Sobre la alfombra
Toca su sombra
Cuenta las luces
Mira la gran ciudad
 
Ana no duerme
Juega con hadas
Tal vez mañana despierte
Sobre el mar, el mar
Sobre el mar, el mar
 
Ana de noche
Hoy es un hada
Canta palabras
Canta y se torna en luz
 
Sobre la alfombra
Toca su sombra
Cuenta las luces
Mira la gran ciudad
 
Ana no duerme
Juega con hadas
Tal vez mañana despierte
Sobre el mar, el mar
Sobre el mar, el mar 
 
CIEGOS Y MUDOS (THE GILLARDS)
Buscas a donde mirar.
Todo es más lindo,
pero tienes que despertar.
 
Quiero verte sonreír
aunque acusen tus palabras
y te hagan enojar.
 
Sé que no es muy grato
lo que tienes que gritar.
Te van a escupir, te van a apedrear,
te van a decir que debes de callar.
 
El bolsillo se llenó.
Aunque duelan esas muertes
el brujo las enterró.
 
Confunden sonrisas
con felicidad.
¿Qué pasa en sus cabezas,
y en esa falsa humildad?
 
No más planes, no más cuentos.
No más vidas y lamentos.
 
Busco y anhelo
la victoria de este amor.
Y le digo al viento
que el tiempo ya llegó.
 
Quiero saber qué pasará
si tarde llego a nuestra salvación.
 
Es un infierno que quemará
las banderas de color.
En la autopista chocarás
y en el pasto llorarás.
 
No más debates y televisión.
No más chantajes y corrupción.
 
Busco y anhelo
la victoria de este amor.
Y le digo al viento
que el tiempo ya llegó.
 
Quiero saber qué pasará
si tarde llego a nuestra salvación.
 
Miento sin parar.
Nadie me cree 
y nadie me recordará.
 
AFTERMATH OF BLOODBATH (THE GILLARDS)
A vagrant was crossing a run-down town.
He wanted to take a closer look.
There were bodies piled up
so their blood lingers in the floor.
 
The hamlet has undergone a war.
Now they're above and below.
Faith is just a lie.
 
I'm a plaything of the wealthy.
They watched me as I bled to death.
Please take me out
of this eternal damnation.
Don't let the people know about...
 
Aftermath of bloodbath,
aftermath of bloodbath,
aftermath of bloodbath.
Since their god has gone.
 
He was a skillful huntsman,
his son was in his tenth year.
Trying to get him out of here
a bullet pierced his heart.
 
An instant before the storm rolled
they sealed their eternal love.
 
Why the shafts 
of devine light are gone?
Surely they're bounded by an imp.
How dare you cut'em down?
Though it's absurd,
you could never feel it.
 
Oh god, come back!
Return it to what
it used to be.
 
Let the bodies sing...
 
I'm a plaything of the wealthy.
They watched me as I bled to death.
 
I'm a plaything of the wealthy.
They watched me as I bleeded to death.
 
Indeed...
 
Aftermath of bloodbath,
aftermath of bloodbath,
 
Since their god has...
 
LAYLA (DEREK AND THE DOMINOS)
What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody is waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
 
Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
I'm begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
 
Tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down
 
Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
I'm Begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
 
Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
Or tell me all my love's in vain
 
Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
I'm begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
 
Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
 
THE HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN (THE ANIMALS)
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
 
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gambling man
Down in New Orleans
 
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he is satisfied
Is when he's all drunk
 
Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
 
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
 
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
 
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
 
THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD (THE BEATLES)
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
 
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why keep me standing here?
Let me know the way
 
Many times, I've been alone
And many times, I've cried
Anyway, you've never known
The many ways I've tried
 
But still, they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
 
But still, they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
 
EARNING LOVE (THE GILLARDS)
Well done, I know I feel 
with you as a man who lives.
From now you carrie on with love and entrepreneurships.
 
They were making fun 
of a fat and smelly man,
while he lived without limits 
and was looking for fun.
 
And then there were none 
that were too strong.
Love is as tall as a magnificent hill.
 
Now you see me earning love
 
Hey hey, the man is here 
with black shirt and long white jeans
He is a conquer machine 
wearing cowboy sunglasses for her.
 
I used to have a gun 
that shot a perfume of love
The secret is that your feelings are 
stable like a stone. 
 
Being head over heels in love 
is what I hide in my velvet gloves.
 
And then there were none 
that were too strong.
Love is as tall as a magnificent hill.
 
Now you see me earning love,
Now you see me earning love,
Now you see me earning love.
 
MY DELUSIONS (THE GILLARDS)
Socializing is
shattering my head.
No religion,
there's no one left to blame. 
 
No races,
no horses to ride. 
No companion,
all flowers shrivelled up.
 
Should I speak my mind?
Would my words sound
somewhat appealing?
 
I look like a dead body
but I am living still.
 
Can they see
what I feel
when I'm standing next to them?
I'm the odd one out,
aren't I?
 
No rejection,
still no mention too.
Could I be born again?
Fighting wildly against my soul.
 
Lock me inside a machine to 
change my eyes and fix my lips.
To change the way I learn and speak.
And I'll be your desired fusion.
 
I want new teeth and feet.
So they will say: "Oh, you're so sweet".
I'm crazy now, no sanity.
The pressure needs to stop.
 
Don't get me wrong, dear mirror.
I still am my true self, 
I swear.
 
It was not born by chance
This is who I wanna be
But is it me
the one who is staring back?
 
MY WHEELS ON THE ROAD (THE GILLARDS)
I'm drivin' up to nowhere.
The wind blowing my hair.
I may not come back
This is my new home.
 
I don't need no company
I only want to stay with
my wheels on the road.
 
I left my town with no chance
to be the same again.
Sometimes I miss my old bed
I found another way to dream.
 
Pride, pride is the only thing I love.
Ride, ride this on my own.
 
My pretty little Harley
you're looking so freaking good
with my Bird lather jacket
and don't forget my boots.
 
I don't need no company
I only want to stay with
my wheels on the road.
 
Pride, pride is the only thing I love.
Ride, ride this on my own.
 
I'm between the meadows
setting my long way.
Some ask me where I'm going.
I'm gonna take back my friends.
 
I donna shoot in vain, honey.
Let me rock it when I use
my microphone and only shout...
 
Oh, my wheels on the road.
Oh, my wheels on the road.
Oh, my wheels on the road.
Oh, my wheels on the... 
 
SEMINARE (SERÚ GIRÁN)
Quiero ver, quiero entrar
Nena nadie te va a hacer mal,
Excepto amarte.
Vas aquí, vas allá
Pero nunca te encontrarás
Al escaparte.
 
No hay fuerza alrededor
No hay pociones para el amor
Dónde estás?
Dónde voy?
Porque estamos en la calle de la sensación
Muy lejos del sol que quema de amor.
 
Te doy pan, quieres sal
Nena nunca te voy a dar
Lo que me pides.
Te doy Dios, quieres más
Es que nunca comprenderás
A un pobre pibe.
 
Esas motos que van a mil
Sólo el viento te harán sentir
Nada más, nada más.
Si pudieras olvidar tu mente
Frente a mi, sé que tu corazón
Diría...
 
No hay fuerza alrededor
No hay pociones para el amor
Dónde estás?
Dónde voy?
Porque estamos en la calle de la sensación
Muy lejos del sol que quema de amor.
Muy lejos del sol que quema de amor.
