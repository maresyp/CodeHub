;# To start the script 'playin' random URLs, you will first need a flat text file list, one 
;# URL per line, saved in the main mIRC directory (such as 'list.txt')
;#
;# To start the script, type (in the channel you want it running in):
;#
;#  /pp [list file] [interval]
;#
;#      Where:
;#
;#        [list file] is the name of the file with the list of URLs, without the extension 
;#          (list.txt would just be 'list' by itself, in the command)
;#
;#        [interval] is the time, in seconds, desired between postings
;#
;# To stop the 'playing' of random URL's simply type (in the same channel where it's playing):
;#
;#  /ps
;#
;#
;# NOTE: there is no configuration needed in this script, simply type the command as described above.
