CB: Don't glare at me like this little bitch!
C1: Don't you find Byung-Min really mean?
C2: I agree ~ Such a narrow-minded bastard, beating a nerd into such a state...
C3: {No, it can't be... It's too one-sided...}*

C3: Min-Soo, wake up! Byung-Min's weak point are his legs, since the beginning he didn't use them to not damage his shoes...!
CB: Answer me honestly, in truth you're just a horny dog trying to fuck the math teacher, am I wrong? Fucking pervert!

TITLE DROPS






N: Hmm...
N: {Should it be so swollen after being hit...?}
N: {I can't believe it, how could his package be so big...?}
N: {It's bothering me, I must take a look...}
N: {For safety purpose, of course...}
N: Alright, I'll examine this part, you don't mind it, right..?
H: Teacher! I brought back Min-Soo's bag, can we leave now?
N: Shit, at the worst moment...
MC: Ugh...
MC: Teacher. I'll go back home, I'm fine now.
N: We can't leave him like this. Han-Na, could you bring him back to his house?
H: Okay but why should it be me?
N: Are you really not going to help me?
Do you know how many times I backed you up when you were skipping class and sleeping in my office?
N: You don't want me to have a conversation with your head teacher ~
H: Oh.

MC: Hey I'm going home alone. My bag, give it back.
H: Do you really think I want to go with you? I'm being threatened by the nurse, so don't make it harder for me!
H: You should just accept my help like an obedient boy. I mean you can't even walk straight, so show me some gratitude...
H: Hey! Wait for me!

MJ: Haaang
MJ: Aaaah
HS: It's been awhile... It feels like my dick is melting inside you...
MJ: Haang... Me too... I love it so much...!
MJ: Come on big boy, do me harder...
