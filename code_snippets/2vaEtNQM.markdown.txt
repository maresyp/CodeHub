I did everything you asked me to do, it's time to keep your promise (text Na So-Ri is writing)

FMC: I'm surprised Miss Na So-Ri, I thought you'd like this kind of atmosphere and have fun with the youngsters,
You know... People will take you for an old lady if you stay by my side.

Tap

N: ...
Pardon?

Me an old lady?

N: Isn't it just because there is nothing fun to do in a place like this that I stay with you?
I've been to countless places like this one so...

How old do you think I'm..?

N: By the way, isn't that the team leader who looks like someone who has nothing to do in such a place?
Trying to have fun in a club at your age, such a waste of time...

Frown-

FMC: Excuse me?
N: And,
N: If I make up my mind, I can still have fun as much as I want.
N: But in your case team leader, even if you wanted to have fun, you couldn't do so ~
N: {See, what did I tell you ~}
{Even if I'm not young anymore I'm still very attractive.}

Rub-

N: Uh?
Random: Would you like to dance with me?
N: ...?!
FMC: ...
FMC: Eh...
FMC: Sounds great.
N: What nonsense is this..?

G: Uh?

Random: I talked to you because you're totally my style
So let's have fun and don't try to run away from me now
Randome: Okay?

Wink-

FMC: {I just followed him to make fun of Na So-Ri...}
{But it's getting annoying now...}
Random: Anyway...
FMC: Aah!
Random: I won't let you run away even if you try.
FMC: {Sigh... Kids aren't joking anymore nowadays...}
FMC: {Well,}
{It won't hurt to enjoy this situation a little more.}
FMC: {I too feel old these days, should I try to have fun like I was used to during my youth?}
