Hello, ACCOUNT_MANAGER_NAME!
 
We will need additional access to proceed with this security patch.
 
<b>ACTION NEEDED FROM YOU:</b>
Would you please reach out to the client for the following credentials?
<ul><li>cPanel (DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE__URL_OR_OTHER_HELPFUL_INFO_TO_HELP_CLIENT_FIND_LOGIN)
      -- We need this access because DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE</li><li>FTP Info (DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE__URL_OR_OTHER_HELPFUL_INFO_TO_HELP_CLIENT_FIND_LOGIN)
      -- We need this access because DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE</li></ul>
Since we are not able to proceed with the patch until the additional information is received, I have assigned this to-do to you to mark it as "on hold".
 
After those credentials have been added to Keeper, please comment here and assign this to-do back to me - we will get this project re-prioritized right away.
 
We have spent DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE hours so far.
We estimate there are DEV_TO_FILL_IN_HERE hours remaining on the project and have updated the estimate in the title accordingly.
 
Thanks!
